# Food Production Cost Optimizer 🍲📊

A full-stack decision-support and analytics platform designed for food manufacturers, production managers, and food technology professionals to calculate, simulate, forecast, and optimize food production costs.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement & Executive Overview

In industrial food processing, determining unit profitability is complex due to:
1. **Unpredictable Raw Material Price Volatility**: Commodity price fluctuations (e.g. fruit pulp, vegetable oils, sugar).
2. **Process Loss & Yield Giveaway**: Thermal evaporation, kettle residue, spilling, and packaging overfill.
3. **High Overhead & Energy Costs**: Steam heating, flash pasteurization, cold storage, and plant depreciation.
4. **Complexity in Scenario Testing**: Lack of immediate feedback when testing "What-If" scenarios before committing to multi-ton production batches.

The **Food Production Cost Optimizer** solves these challenges by combining a **deterministic mathematical calculation engine**, a **dual-scenario What-If sandbox**, an **algorithmic cost-reduction optimizer**, a **statistical cost forecasting engine**, and a **context-aware AI advisor**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🧮 Production Cost Calculator
- Multi-ingredient formulation table with live unit price line-item summation.
- Categorized cost inputs: Packaging, Direct Labour, Electricity/Energy, Water Utilities, Transportation/Logistics, Fixed Plant Overheads, and Expected Wastage Loss (%).
- Instant precision output: Total Production Cost, Cost per Batch, Cost per Sellable Unit (kg/L/pack), Gross Profit, Gross Margin %, ROI %, and Contribution Margin.

### 2. ⚡ What-If Scenario Simulator
- Dual-column comparison: **Current Baseline Batch** vs **Simulated Scenario**.
- Interactive sliders for:
  - Ingredient price variance (-30% to +50%)
  - Process wastage rate shift (-5% to +10%)
  - Production batch scale multiplier (-50% to +200%)
  - Packaging, labour, energy adjustments
  - Target selling price repositioning
- Dynamic delta metrics displaying exact cash impact, unit cost shift, net profit change, and margin point variance.

### 3. 💡 Production Optimization Engine
- Algorithmic evaluation of batch composition.
- Detects high single-ingredient concentration risks (>20% total cost share), excessive wastage loss (>5%), packaging over-expenditure (>18%), and sub-optimal profit margins (<15%).
- Generates data-backed cost-saving recommendations with estimated minimum and maximum savings ranges.

### 4. 🤖 AI Production Cost Advisor
- Natural language query interface allowing users to ask operational questions ("How can I reduce unit cost?", "Why is my cost high?", "How to achieve 25% margin?").
- Context-aware: Automatically feeds structured active batch parameters to Google Gemini / OpenAI LLM APIs.
- Includes a **deterministic rule-based offline fallback engine** so the app keeps working when API keys are omitted.

### 5. 📈 Time-Series Cost Forecasting
- Forecasts future production unit costs using **Holt's Double Exponential Smoothing** and **Linear Trend Regression**.
- Computes 95% confidence intervals and standard errors.
- Visual time-series bar plot comparing historical actuals against 6-month predictive projections.
- CSV export functionality.
- Without a real batch history the app shows a clearly labeled **Sample Demo Dataset** (12 months of believable monthly history for **Premium Mango Jam**); it is marked as DEMO/sample data in the UI and is not real production records.

### 6. 🚚 Supplier Landed Cost Analysis
- Multi-supplier quote comparison matrix.
- Calculates **Net Effective Landed Unit Cost** = Base Unit Price + Transport Logistics Cost per Unit.
- Evaluates Lead Time (days), Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ), Quality Rating (1-5 stars), and Reliability Score (%).

### 7. 📦 Batch Management & Comparison
- Complete CRUD operations for production batches.
- Batch cloning/duplication for fast scenario creation.
- Pre-loaded industry recipe presets: *Mango Jam, Tomato Ketchup, Butter Biscuits, Tropical Fruit Juice, Raw Mango Pickle*.
- Side-by-side **Batch A vs Batch B** comparative audit tool.

### 8. 🔒 Security & Authentication
- JWT token-based authentication with secure password hashing (`bcryptjs`).
- Clearly labeled **DEMO access** mode ("Enter DEMO Mode") for instant evaluation without registration — loads sample data only and does not create a real user account.
- Secrets are loaded from environment variables via `.env` (see `.env.example`). Note: `server/middleware/authMiddleware.js` ships with a development-only fallback JWT secret — set a strong `JWT_SECRET` in production. In its default demo configuration the app runs a guest-first experience with a JSON file store; treat it as a portfolio/demo deployment until a real database and strict auth policies are configured.

## 📐 Mathematical Formulas & Calculation Engine

The business calculation engine (`server/utils/calculator.js` & `client/src/utils/calculator.js`) follows standardized industrial food engineering formulas:

1. **Raw Material Cost**:
   $$\text{Raw Material Cost} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\text{Quantity}_i \times \text{Unit Price}_i)$$

2. **Direct Production Cost**:
   $$\text{Direct Cost} = \text{Raw Materials} + \text{Packaging} + \text{Labour} + \text{Energy} + \text{Water} + \text{Logistics}$$

3. **Wastage Cost**:
   $$\text{Wastage Cost} = \text{Direct Cost} \times \left( \frac{\text{Wastage \%}}{100} \right)$$

4. **Total Production Cost**:
   $$\text{Total Cost} = \text{Direct Cost} + \text{Wastage Cost} + \text{Fixed Overhead}$$

5. **Sellable Net Quantity**:
   $$\text{Sellable Quantity} = \text{Batch Quantity} \times \left( 1 - \frac{\text{Wastage \%}}{100} \right)$$

6. **Unit Production Cost**:
   $$\text{Cost Per Unit} = \frac{\text{Total Production Cost}}{\text{Sellable Quantity}}$$

7. **Gross Profit & Margin**:
   $$\text{Gross Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Production Cost}$$
   $$\text{Profit Margin \%} = \left( \frac{\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Total Revenue}} \right) \times 100$$

8. **Break-Even Volume & Price**:
   $$\text{Contribution Margin / Unit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Variable Cost / Unit}$$
   $$\text{Break-Even Quantity} = \left\lceil \frac{\text{Fixed Overhead}}{\text{Contribution Margin / Unit}} \right\rceil$$
   $$\text{Break-Even Selling Price} = \frac{\text{Total Production Cost}}{\text{Sellable Quantity}}$$

## ⚙️ Installation & Running Locally

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: v18.0.0 or higher
- **NPM**: v9.0.0 or higher

### Quick Start (Zero-Config)
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fafda-Jalebi/food-production-cost-optimizer.git
   cd "Food Production Cost Optimizer"
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   A single `npm install` at the root installs the root, server, and client packages (via a `postinstall` script):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Alternatively, install each package explicitly:
   ```bash
   npm install && npm install --prefix server && npm install --prefix client
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Run Unit Tests**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

5. **Start the Application**:
   - **Development**: run the API server and the Vite client in two terminals.
     ```bash
     npm run server      # API at http://localhost:5000
     npm run client      # Vite dev UI at http://localhost:3000
     ```
   - **Production (single service)**: build the client, then start the Express server which serves both the frontend and `/api` from the same origin.
     ```bash
     npm run build
     npm start           # App + API at http://localhost:5000
     ```

## 🌐 Deployment Guide

### Single-Service Production Deployment (Recommended)
This project runs as a **single service**: the Express backend serves the production React build from `client/dist`, and the `/api` endpoints are served from the **same origin**. No separate frontend host, reverse proxy, or CORS setup is required.

1. **Install all dependencies** (at the repository root — installs the root, server, and client packages):
   ```bash
   npm install && npm install --prefix server && npm install --prefix client && npm run build
   ```
2. **Start the production server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. The application is available at `http://localhost:5000`. Any non-API route returns the built frontend (`client/dist`), while `/api/*` requests are handled by the Express backend. If `client/dist` has not been built, the server runs API-only and logs a warning.

### Persistence Note
The application persists data to a local JSON file store (`server/data/store.json`). This is convenient for **demo and portfolio use** and runs with zero configuration, but it is **not** a persistent, production-grade cloud database. For real production deployments, integrate MongoDB (via `MONGODB_URI`) or another managed database and harden authentication. MongoDB/Mongoose connection support is scaffolded but is not currently used for application persistence.

### Environment Variables
Set `JWT_SECRET`, and optionally `GEMINI_API_KEY` for the AI Advisor (the app gracefully falls back to an offline rule engine when no key is configured). `MONGODB_URI` is optional and only activates MongoDB if provided.
